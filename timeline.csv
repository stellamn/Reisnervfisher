"March 14, 1914","George Byron Gordon writes to Reisner about positions of Curator and Assistant Curator to be filled at The University Museum, Philadelphia","Addressed to Reisner : Kerma, Dongola Province, Sudan. Note: G.B. Gordon was the U. Penn Museum Director from 1910-1927"
"June 9, 1914","Fisher writes Reisner that he has been offered the Curator position by Gordon, felt sure of Reisner’s support and the use of “some of the men.”","Written on Museum of Fine Arts Boston stationery, Fisher mentions: “Last November when I left you …” and “In January came the sudden Jerusalem offer…” He mentions visiting Professor Laird at the School of Architecture who assured him “ that all the old animus was gone…” and tells Reisner, “So you see they are all anxious to make good to me the bitter disappointment of the past eight years and the injustice with which they treated me.”
Fisher mentions his feud with some one named Raymond and his disapproval of Reisner having anything to do with Dunham, Raymond’s friend."
"June 24, 1914",Fisher writes to Reisner that he has received official notification of his appointment to be Curator of the Egyptian department at the U. of P. Again mentions using the men that Reisner cannot use.,"Fisher acknowledges (on MFA stationery) that Gordon told him that Reisner has recommended him for the position. Asks Reisner to help him pick a site.
 “Mentions: “No men whom you have discharged or do not want me to have, would not be desired.”
 “[Lyman] Story has gone back on his word after asking me to take him as assistant.” Story disapproves of Fisher trying to interfere with Raymond’s future at the Museum. “He thinks I am unfair and unjust to him …”
 In a P.S. Fisher asks Reisner to settle a bill he received from Raymond for the paper and toner used for Raymond’s photographs."
"August 2, 1914","“…owing to the unsettled state of Europe* and the withdrawal of many steamships, I have had to cancel my passage on the “Franconia” August 4th.”","Fisher, writing from Cambridge, MA, doesn’t know when he will be able to cross so he will work in Philadelphia and do some work for Reisner “when I come out in the fall.” Three pages about Raymond Howe owing him money, Reisner writing a letter of recommendation for Howe, and how it makes him, Fisher, look bad. Similar problems with another enemy, Mr. West, who evidently also carried an unexpected and, according to Fisher, undeserved, letter of recommendation from Reisner.
 Mentions needing to speak to Reisner about the American Institute Egyptian Committee, “before you took any action in the matter with them” and also about the “Samaria matter”. No details on what these matters were.
 Mentions that The Boston American has just come out with an interview with Howe about Giza."
1914,Start of WW 1,"‘Austrian Archduke Francis Ferdinand and wife assassinated in Sarajevo by Serbian nationalist, Gavrilo Princip (June 28). Austria declares war on Serbia (July 28).

Germans defeat Russians in Battle of Tannenberg on Eastern Front (Aug.). First Battle of the Marne (Sept.). German drive stopped 25 miles from Paris. By end of year, war on the Western Front is “positional” in the trenches.” Also see http://www.public.asu.edu/~snodevil/330crises.html and http://raven.cc.ukans.edu/~kansite/ww_one/timeline/timesrch.htm#1914 for more detailed timelines."
"October 5, 1914",Gordon writes to Reisner from U of P to thank him for assisting Fisher in selecting a site. Asks if there is any danger in Egypt which would prevent exploration.,He reports Fisher has told him that some Europeans have abandoned their concessions in Egypt.
"December 7, 1914",Reisner writes to Mr. Graham about the imminent arrival of Fisher in Egypt.,"Reisner says he has convinced the U of P to resume their plans for a dig in Egypt. Fisher will arrive on the S.S. India, due in at Port Said around December 15th"
"April 27, 1915","Fisher writes to Reisner details about employing men they are sharing, a recent discovery of artifacts, and asks “Where is Story!?”","Fisher writes on stationery with the header:
 UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA
 THE ECKLEY COXE JUNIOR EGYPTIAN EXPEDITION
 CAIRO, EGYPT."
"October 28, 1915",Fisher writes to Reisner about the “one-sided” division of the Memphis things with M. Lacau yesterday.,"Fisher, writing from Mit-Rahineh, on expedition stationery mentions that he is going “up the river” and is “leaving Saturday night.”

 Suspects a fraud on the part of one of the men concerning the purchase of a horse."
"August 6, 1916",Reisner asks Fisher to lone him the services of Mr. Sanborn for 6 months.,"Reisner writes from Harvard Camp at the pyramids.
 Check out this address for a detailed description of the life of Sanborn. Very interesting.
 http://oasis.harvard.edu/dfap/html/sch00122.html"
"October, 1916",There is some undocumented conflict between Fisher and Reisner at this time.,"In his statement to Gordon sent January 9, 1918, Reisner refers to letters he received from Fisher in April of 1917. “I was greatly pleased with these two letters from Fisher which meant to me the restoration of the friendly relations interrupted by the events of the preceding October.” While on a visit to Reisner, Fisher abruptly left camp, evidently in a huff, and Reisner never found out why."
"November 4, 1916","Gordon sends telegram asking, “will situation disturb excavation.”","Not clear what situation Gordon is referring to, perhaps death of Coxe. Telegram sent to Reisner in Cairo."
"November 10, 1916","Fisher writes to Reisner, “that provision has been made for the expedition.”",Fisher writes from Dendereh.. Discusses “Petrie missed the whole key to the site …” Mentions “We will be pleased to have you stay over a day or two here on your way up river.”
"November, 1916",Reisner leaves Cairo for the Sudan.,"Reisner mentions this in his statement to Gordon sent on January 9th, 1918."
1916,"Death of Eckley Brinton Coxe, Jr. sponsor of U. of P. expedition.","“Eckley Brinton Coxe, Jr. (1872-1916). An avid admirer of Egyptian civilization from childhood, Eckley B. Coxe directed his interest toward the acquisition of the outstanding collections that surround a visitor to the Egyptian Galleries of the Museum. Mr. Coxe, the descendant of a prominent Delaware Valley Colonial family, and the inheritor of an anthracite coal fortune, personally financed Museum expeditions to Nubia and Egypt. The earliest of these, in 1907, gave the modern world its first factual knowledge of ancient Nubian civilization. The last Coxe Expedition, to Memphis in 1915, resulted in the discovery of the Palace of Merenptah, splendid remnants of which are displayed in the Museum.
 During his tenure as President of the Board of Managers of the Museum (1910-16), Eckley Coxe contributed large sums to general operating expenses. Never robust, however, he fell ill and died at the early age of 44 in 1916. His reputation as one of the most generous Philadelphians survived him due to his munificent endowment of the Museum's Egyptian Section. Receiving the income from one-half million dollars in perpetuity, the Egyptian Section was able to finance all of its activities from this endowment, including professional salaries, collection maintenance, expeditions, and publications, until the 1950s.”"
"November 7, 1916",Woodrow Wilson re-elected President of the United States.,"By virtue of this legislation [child labor and 8 hour day for railroad workers] and the slogan “he kept us out of war,” Wilson narrowly won re-election."
"November 17, 1916",Fisher writes to Reisner about Mr. Coxe’s death and awaiting news about the financial fate of the expedition.,Writing from Keneh [Qina].Received sum from museum to continue work until January 1st. Asks to postpone repayment of debt to Reisner (£60.) Writes in the positive about the election of Wilson as president of the U.S. Looking for a draftsman to make drawings of wall paintings in the offering chamber of Snefru-hotep mastaba. Trusts Mary in now quite herself again.
"November 26, 1916","Fisher writes Reisner, returns book and talks politic—pro Wilson.",Writing from Dendereh.
"December 18, 1916",Reisner writes to Fisher that Mr. Farnell has given assurance that Fisher’s expedition will be fully protected in case the question of the Memphis concession comes up before the Comite d’Archeologie.,"Reisner writes from Kareima, Sudan."
"January 9, 1917","Fisher writes to Reisner about Coxe’s “magnificent provision” for the Egyptian Section of the University.
 Discusses Reisner’s loan of men to him and suggests sharing resources in the future.
 Upset that he had not heard from Mr. Farnall directly.","Writing from Dendereh. Plans to continue work at Memphis and plans to devote one more season to Dendereh, but not sure. The workman are not happy with the site because they are not finding a large amount of valuable antiquities. Fisher is happy finding lots “archeological facts.” Complains about having to pay lots of baksheesh to the men in lieu of payment for finds.
 Sends a complete list of the men in his employ asking Reisner which men he wants back."
"February 2, 1917","Fisher writes to Reisner about misunderstandings in the allocation of men. Obvious tension on the subject of employees building.
 Misunderstandings on the request to do recordings on Reisner’s Giza concession.","Fisher writes from Dendereh that he has no recollection of Reisner ever permanently turning over all the men to him, but if he had why should Reisner complain about payment of back wages and why should Fisher find that some of these men “had been ordered off to the Sudan” without his knowing about it. Fisher had wanted Reisner to take back some of the men so that he could build a new organization. The men who had worked for Reisner were being paid at too high a rate for Fisher’s budget. Believes the men have been spoiled by “excessive baksheeshing.” Mentions dissatisfaction and bad attitude among the men, especially due to the raise in pay Reisner gave his own men.
 Note: From notes in his statement of January 9, 1918 prepared for Gordon, Reisner regards this letter as Fisher’s “advice to me how to run my expedition.”"
"April 6, 1917",United States declares war on Germany and enters the First World War.,
"April 19, 1917",Fisher writes to Reisner to ask for a statement in support of the U of P’s claim to the Memphis site over Petrie’s.,"Fisher writes from Mit-Rahineh. Complains that Petrie shows no “intention to make a public apology for the libel against the good name of our Museum.” Petrie claims that Fisher took advantage the war as an excuse to steal Memphis from him.
 Fisher uses the recent declaration of war to try to smooth the differences he has been having in his relationship with Reisner. “Such differences…are insignificant in comparison with the great national impulses which are now stirring in America.”
 Plans to continue at Dendereh and Memphis indefinitely. Will work until the end of June and spend July and August on the dahabiyeh at Gezireh. Will leave in September for Dendereh."
May 10. 1917,Reisner leaves Sudan for Cairo.,"Reisner mentions this in his statement to Gordon sent on January 9th, 1918."
"May 14, 1917",Fisher writes to Reisner and asks him to come to the dahabiyeh “in order to talk over very serious matters.”,"Fisher writes from Mit-Rahineh, Badrashein. Handwritten in pencil on the back of this letter Fisher writes; “I am told Mahmud has gone to you no doubt with his usual lies. I trust to your honor as an American and a white man to hear the charges the white man has to present. Mr. Sanborn will sustain all my statements.”
 Congratulates Reisner on his success in the Sudan."
"May 15, 1917",Reisner arrives in Cairo in the morning.,"Reisner mentions this in his statement to Gordon sent on January 9th, 1918"
"May 16, 1917",Fisher telegraphs Reisner,"“Will meet you Continental for lunch.” Office of origin—Cairo. Apparently Reisner did not go. See his statement to Gordon January 9, 1918."
"May 16, 1917","Fisher responds very negatively to Reisner’s last letter which we do not have, but there is a description of it in Reisner’s statement to Gordon written in January of 1918. It was perhaps an angry letter.","Fisher writes from the Grand Continental Hotel, Cairo. Handwritten, emotional letter, almost illegible.
 Accuses Reisner of saying specific negative things about him. He plans to talk to Reisner next Wednesday at the hotel to discuss “your intentions to employ Mahmoud” and a “a great many things left unsettled.”
 In a P.S. “For your own university’s sake don’t let your inexplicable devotion to any black man blind you to your duties to your own race.”"
"May 16, 1917",Reisner writes to Fisher that he would be glad to meet.,"Reisner, writing from the Pyramids, Cairo, mentions that just before he left Nuri he received Fisher’s letter proposing a more friendly footing between them. He wants to meet with Fisher, and Sanborn as well, but not at the hotel. He prefers Fisher’s dahabiyeh for their talk."
"May 16, 1917",Reisner responds point by point to Fisher’s previous letter and asks Fisher to be “cool and reasonable.”,"Reisner writes from the Pyramids. He denies he ever said he “did not want that damn Fisher out here.” Reisner says they must agree to disagree on the Mrs. Fisher matter. He also states he has not taken Mahmud el-Meyyit’s statement over Fisher’s but that Fisher has given no hint as to Mahmud’s offences. Reisner reminds Fisher that Fisher has employed a man that he, Reisner, discharged. “I am getting old and hurried and want only friendliness not enmity with the people I respect.”"
"May 20, 1917","Fisher to Reisner with times he will be available to meet on the “Hapi’ his dahabiyeh to discuss their problems. “You will find me willing to renew old relations, when the native barrier is removed.”","Fisher writes from Mit-Rahineh that the matter lies in Reisner’s hands. He says he had good reason to dismiss Mahmud and that “It is usually accepted that the word of a white man is better than that of a native, but I am sorry to say that several times during the past two years you have thought it best to think otherwise.” Believes if Reisner intends to support Mahmud that it must be intended as an insult and will destroy the “white man’s authority over these people.” Wants to prevent Mahmud el-Mayyit from “being ever again employed by any expedition in Egypt or elsewhere.” Fisher says that the matter is “wholly of your own creating….”"
"May 23, 1917",Reisner agrees to meet Fisher at his dahabiyeh at 3 o’clock this afternoon.,"Reisner writes from Harvard Camp. This is a Wednesday. The discussions at this meeting, including the details of Fisher’s complaints against Mahmud, are summed up in Reisner’s statement to Gordon of January 9, 1918."
"May 26, 1917",Fisher write to Reisner about additional matters in connection with their interview last Wednesday. Mainly money he believes the dismissed men owe his expedition.,"Fisher writes from Mit-Rahineh. He details all of the items he believes the dismissed men wrongfully took with them when they left, including clothes and watches. He includes a list of some of the dismissed men and what loans he expects them to pay back to the expedition by the end of June.
 “I await therefore with a great deal of interest the results of your conference with reis Saeed and his brother.”"
"June 7, 1917","Fisher writes to Reisner that he received the parcel with some articles taken away by the men who left. He encloses a list of his men and asks Reisner to indicate who has worked for him and why they were dismissed.
 Would be glad to meet again on Wednesday on the dahabiyeh.","Fisher writing from Mit-Rahineh indicates that Reisner has not yet responded to his previous letter and that he expects the other missing articles and the money by July 1st.
 The fact that Mahmud is still under Reisner’s protection “is having a very injurious effect on the prestige of another American Expedition, and it is a thing which this expedition will not stand for.”"
"June 8, 1917","Reisner to Fisher with details on how Fisher’s hiring members of the Firnisis family have caused lots of prestige problems at Reisner’s expedition.
 Reisner can’t come to town and meet with Fisher because of work but is willing to entertain Fisher at his camp.","Reisner writes from the Pyramids. Argues that the prestige of Fisher’s expedition is not in trouble but his own is due to a decline in funds. Reisner is upset with Fisher’s man Salman Salim who had been spreading rumors to everyone that Fisher said Reisner’s expedition was a financial wreck. Reisner admits it may possibly be true but that the story is causing great harm to his expedition.
 He has not dealt with the Mahmud el-Mayyet issue yet because the man he wants to talk to about it is Said and he is not back yet from Keft.
 Mentions investigating the return of Ahmed Musa, the German guard, to Luxor after the destruction of the German House, in relation to people who deal illegally in antiquities."
"June 14, 1917",Fisher to Reisner refutes Reisner’s previous letter point by point. More demands that Mahmud be “adequately and publicly punished by you for his insolence to us.”,"Fisher writes from Mit-Rahineh. He says the men who left with Mahmud said that Reisner would compel Fisher to take them all back.
 Fisher says the only time he mentioned funding for expeditions was in front of Mahmud so if someone was spreading stories they came from Mahmud.
 Fisher says it is very difficult to find men whom Reisner has not at some time or other dismissed.
 Fisher will be leaving for Alexandria on July 1st for the summer."
"June 25, 1917","Fisher to Reisner demanding a resolution to the Mahmud el-Mayyet matter exactly as he expects, at once.","Fisher writes from Mit-Rahineh. Fisher mentions that Reisner fully agreed with the “right and justice of our dismissing him, even going so far as to say that you would have done it sooner and have been more drastic.”
 Fisher plans to be in Cairo next Friday and Saturday and “if you have any explanation to make we shall be glad to see you at the dahabiyeh.”"
"June 26, 1917",Apparently unsent letter from Reisner to Gordon detailing the very complex relationships between the working men and the reasons he is unable to dismiss Mahmud.,"Reisner writing from the Pyramids.
 “I arrived at pyramid camp on May 15 after a hard 5 days journey from Kareima.”
 This letter ends in mid-word on page 5. No page 6 in the folder.
 This letter is a great resource for an in-depth description of family relationships and how they affected the native employees of expeditions and hence the ability of expeditions to maintain a decent work force and avoid a “family strike.” It is also a level-headed description of the Fisher-Reisner conflict from Reisner’s point of view. The letter is followed in the file by a type-written list of 49 names of workmen with penciled in family relationships and other details. A list of 49 men is mentioned in this letter by Reisner as being the list sent to him by Fisher of his current employees."
"June 27, 1917","Another unsent letter, this time to Fisher. Returning Fisher’s list of men marked as asked. Angry repudiation of Fisher’s position regarding Mahmud.","Reisner writing from the Pyramids..
 A note in the margin of this letter (Reisner’s hand?) says “not sent substance communicated verbally on June 29 Friday”
 “You have repeatedly accused me of ‘devotion to a black man’. …My devotion is simply to my duty to the expedition and to my determination to give justice as far as I can to every one, black as well as white.”
 Plans to be at Fisher dahabiyeh on Friday morning."
1917,"2 undated pages, obviously addressing Fisher but not complete. More explanations of why Reisner feels Fisher is unjustified in his demands.","These pages seem to be part of a drafting of Reisner’s thoughts, not actual letters."
"June 27, 1917",Short note from Reisner to Fisher about his plans to be at the dahabiyeh on Friday morning.,"Written from Harvard Camp. It is interesting that this carbon has two sides with essentially the same message on each. However, one side is polite and genial, and the other is terse and irritated. From its state of completion it looks like the terse one is the one he sent."
"June 29, 1917","Reisner along with Mr. Kemp, meets Fisher and Sanborn on the dahabiyeh “Hapi” around 9 AM.","Details of the meeting according to Reisner are written up in his long statement to Gordon sent on January 9th, 1918 approximately page 12."
"July 3, 1917",Reisner writes a confidential letter to Fairbanks explaining the situation in case he hears only Fisher’s side of it from Gordon.,"“We have now settled the question in dispute in front of witnesses and to my satisfaction.”
 Describes the second meeting of Fisher and Reisner on June 29th in which they discussed the exact nature of Fisher’s complaint against Mahmud el-Mayyet. Reisner promised to talk it over with his head reis Said. Reisner said that Fisher agreed to reorganize his gang to get rid of the predominance of the men of Awedat and that Reisner could keep Mahmud until Fisher had completed his reorg at which time Reisner would get rid of Mahmud. He also says, “ …Fisher and Sanborn have shown themselves quite unequal to the task of handling natives and … I have no expectation that they will be able to affect a reorganization such as they desire.”
 “[Mahmud’s] sole offence was against Fisher’s vanity.”
 Reisner mentions having discussed it with Lansing, Quibell and Crowfoot.
 He went to meet Fisher last Friday after having finished his Sudan divisions."
"September 17, 1917",Reisner to Fisher. Asks if Fisher has made up his mind about what tasks he will be taking to reorganize his staff.,"Reisner writes from Harvard Camp. The real message in this letter is in a short paragraph mixed in with several friendly business-as-usual paragraphs. Can you come to lunch, would like to borrow a book, finished repot on Nuri kings, etc."
"September 19, 1917",Fisher to Reisner responding to the business-as-usual aspects of Reisner’s previous letter but does not respond to Reisner’s question about his reorganization plans.,Fisher writes from Badrashein. Sounds friendly.
"September 22, 1917",Short note to Fisher from Reisner noting that Fisher did not answer his question.,Reisner writes from Harvard Camp. Also notes that Fisher has ignored his lunch invitation.
1917,Sanborn visits Reisner at the Pyramids with a message from Fisher.,"Details of this meeting are in Reisner’s statement prepared for Dr. Gordon sent on January 9th, 1918, around page 13. Essentially the message was that Fisher denies there was any agreement between them."
"September 28, 1917","Fisher writes to Reisner details about the employment of certain men by his expedition, i.e., who’s coming and who’s going.","Fisher writes from Mit-Rahineh. He says’ “Mr. Sanborn has reported to me your conversation in regard to workmen.”
 Reports that, “We are leaving here October 15th and hope to have Mr. Lansing as our guest.”"
"September 30, 1917",Reisner writes to Fisher that his letter of September 28th is “satisfactory to me and I am prepared to carry out my part of the arrangement.”,Reisner writes from Harvard Camp with advice about Berberi Mahmud. He also suggests a good site to take Lansing to.
"December 10, 1917",Reisner to Fisher wanting an update on where things stand.,"Letter addressed from the Pyramids P.O.
 “Dear Fisher, Since the exchange of letters resulting from Sanborn’s call, I have heard nothing of you or your doings. I am leaving here on Thursday for the Sudan, …let me know before I leave on how matters stand. I have refrained from taking on any men who left you last year in fulfillment of my part of the agreement. Yours sincerely,”"
"December 13, 1917",Fisher to Reisner claiming that Reisner still misunderstands. He planned to reorganize his staff anyway and does not acknowledge that there was any agreement. Quotes supporting statements from Gordon. Planning a legal accusation against Mahmud.,"Fisher writes from Dendereh and sends this letter by messenger to reach Reisner at Keneh on his way to Luxor. The messenger is Hamid Selah, a man dismissed by Reisner, which he think may possibly be intended as an insult by Fisher. Reisner says this in his long statement to Gordon sent January 9th, 1918.
 Fisher claims that he entered in to no agreement and “That this expedition never has demanded nor does it intend to demand that you employ or dismiss any man…”
 He also says that Mahmud and the guards stole things from the camp at Denderah.
 Wants his books back."
"December 26, 1917",Reisner to Gordon asking for his arbitration in the dispute with Fisher.,"Reisner writes from Kareima, Sudan. These pages seem to be a rough draft and may be somewhat different than the final letter. He is planning to copy all of his of correspondence with explanations and, though it will take time, he hopes that Gordon will suspend judgment until he can prepare this statement."
"January 2, 1918",Reisner writes to a Mr. Haines (from the Ministry?) asking him to read an enclosed letter in defense of Mahmud el-Mayyit who has been questioned by an Inspector at the Pyramids.,"Reisner writes from Kareima, Sudan. This note starts with, “Following my telegram of this date…”
 Apparently Fisher has followed thorough and brought charges against Mahmud. Reisner apologizes for troubling Haines with what should be a private matter.
 There is a piece of the rough draft of the enclosed letter on the back of this one that talks about Fisher’s vindictiveness and the fact that Fisher waited until Reisner had left Egypt to a place “where there is only one mail a week” to bring charges. “He clearly did not desire that my evidence should be considered…”
 The enclosed letter makes the above point more diplomatically.
 Reisner details what he knows of the complaints Fisher has against Mahmud and why they are unjustifiable. He makes Fisher sound petty. “The whole affair considered on the facts is a petty one with which I would be ashamed to trouble the department if the inspector had not taken it up.”"
"January 9, 1918",Reisner mails his statement with an explanatory letter to Dr. Gordon at the U. of P. as promised and “I leave the matter to your judgment.”,"Reisner writes from Kareima, Sudan. Harvard Camp Nuri Pyramids.
 Reisner believes that Gordon has formed a derogatory opinion of him based on Fisher’s reports.
 Reisner mentions that he has not had a vacation since 1911 and works 7 days because he is always understaffed.
 It is clear from this letter that at one point, because of something that Fisher had said in his letter of May 14th, Reisner had believed that Fisher deliberately planned to discharge men that Reisner had recommended and to take on men that he had discharged, as a deliberate insult. He explains why he doesn’t believe this anymore.
 Reisner partially blames himself for not handling this better.
 Reisner suspects that Fisher’s charges of theft to Mahmud, well after the fact of his dismissal, may have been instigated by members of Mahmud’s enemies, the Faid family, especially Khalleel Ahmed who replaced Mahmud as reis and who may have been trying to secure his own position.
 Reisner has excerpted all of their relevant exchanges, written and verbal, in the accompanying document, of which there are two, (not carbon copies), in the MFA archive file. This 18 page document his a very detailed, sometimes hour by hour, description of what specifically happened during this dispute, as Reisner saw it. Includes the history of his relationships with Mahmud el-Mayyit and with Khalleel Ahmed.
 There is an interesting statement on page regarding white men and black men telling the truth.
 He also explains that he understands Fisher’s nervous temperament and difficulty in speaking so has always felt lenient towards him and was prepared to endure his insults.
 There is a quotation of the evidence of Berberi Mahmud, a witness in Fisher’s camp, that states Mahmud gave notice and quit because Fisher wasn’t happy with the way thins were going.
 Praises Fisher’s potential . “In ten years or less he should be the most important archaeologist in Egypt…”"
"February 28, 1918",Reisner writes to Fairbanks mentioning the time delay in getting mail and what to do if anything should happen to him because of he war.,Reisner writes from the Nuri Pyramids. He details his latest finds and discusses the faithful services of Said Ahmed Said.
"May 24, 1918",G.B. Gordon writes to Reisner that he has waited more than four months for the statement that Reisner has promised him and has not received it.,"Mentions that he has a copy of Fisher’s diary on file. He does his best to settle he matter without all the information. This letter was sent in triplicate, most likely because of the difficulty of getting mail through during the war."
"June 20, 1918",G.B. Gordon writes to Reisner his resolution of the conflict with Fisher.,"Reisner sent a copy of his January 9th letter on March 21st because his original was lost at sea. The March 21st letter was “soaked in the sea.” Gordon assumes the mail bag with this letter was rescued from a torpedoed ship. It was still legible. Reisner also sent the same letter under separate cover that arrived 10 days later without harm.
 Gordon finds that Mahmud was dismissed legitimately but that they hold him blameless for the conduct of Mahmud. He says it “might be difficult for any newcomer to organize a gang without running the risk of employing someone whom you had at some time dismissed.” He also states, “In demanding of you the dismissal of Reis Mahmud, Mr. Fisher was therefore clearly wrong.”
  “I can see nothing to stand in the way of friendly relations.”"
"June 24, 1918","Reisner writes to Fisher a very polite letter that has nothing to do with their conflict. There will be no more letters on the subject, at least in this file.","Reisner writes from Harvard Camp at the Pyramids. He says, “your note of June 22 has just arrived.”
 This letter starts a discussion of the possibility of Fisher recovering for Reisner some objects that had been stolen."
"June 27, 1918",Fisher to Reisner with details of the whereabouts of he stolen property.,Fisher writes from Mit-Rahineh. The missing statue and stele are in the hands of the dealer Tano. The information was supplied to Fisher by an Englishman on the condition that Tano not be prosecuted. They can be bought back for £120.
"June 29, 1918",Reisner writes to Fisher and asks him to buy back the pieces.,Reisner writes from Harvard camp. He thinks that if he handles the purchase it “might frighten the holders of the stele and cause delay.” He says the statue belongs to the Eckley Coxe expedition and the stele to the Department of Antiquities. It is not clear why Reisner feels responsible for the recovery and why he is paying for their return.
"June 29, 1918",Fisher to Reisner agreeing to try to secure the two pieces.,Fisher writes from Mit-Rahineh. He asks Reisner for a “rough description of your piece…”
"July 1, 1918",Reisner to Fisher with a description of the stele.,"Reisner writes from Harvard Camp, Pyramids. Suggests threatening Tano with prosecution in a subtle way if he “behaves badly.”"
"July 2, 1918",Fisher to Reisner with more details about how the missing objects were spotted.,"Fisher from Mit-Raheineh. Lansing spotted the little statue in Tano’s shop. Mr. Carter (I assume, Howard) two moths ago said he new exactly where it was and would get back to Fisher. Carter said Tano had it along with them stele and would not sell them except together. Carter was the one who did not want Tano prosecuted because he did a lot of business with him. Fisher plans to ask Carter to reconsider."
"July 4, 1918",Reisner to Fisher that it may be a bad idea to prosecute Tano and he explains why.,"Reisner fro Harvard Camp, Pyramids. “I am willing, if necessary, to go to the length of paying the £120 to a man who appears to have been an innocent purchaser (i.e., as far as any dealer is ever an innocent purchaser).”"

 Reisner has not been able to complete the agreement with M. Lacau “either for my own things or for yours.” Lacau plans to keep the offering bowl. The delay won’t matter because nothing can be shipped until next summer.
 “I am leaving next week for the Sudan and will return in April.”"
"December 22, 1918",Fisher to Reisner that he has no record of any agreement with the Service.,"Fisher writes from Badrashein. He writes about the records from his dig in Reisner’s concession and his interaction with the M. Lacau and Mr. Daressy on the subject of the division.

The deportation of these Wafd leaders resulted in a national insurrection which the British army had to suppress.”

Interestingly, on the back of this positive note about seeing Dr. Gordon is a crossed out negative version in which he says he is too busy to go to lunch but he could do it tomorrow. He also complains about giving up the three hours for the trip. Politeness won out over convenience."
"September 14, 1919",Reisner writes to Gordon thanks for the invitation to visit in Cairo but because of the tram strike he won’t be able to come.,"Reisner writes from Harvard Camp, Pyramids. Reisner is busy on his Kerma publication.

"August 16, 1932",Fisher to Reisner asking if it is possible to “arrange for me on the half year basis for the next few years until you are in a better position to maintain me on a full year basis?”,"Fisher writes from Ramallah.

Asks Fisher if remembers anything about a missing map.
 Tells Fisher of a rumor that had been going around that Fisher had been killed in Southern Mesopotamia..
 Note: It seems to me that of all the letters Reisner has ever written to Fisher, this one is the most illustrative of the sort of man Dr. Reisner really was. It is the most kind, inclusive, and reassuring letter, absolutely without condescension, that one colleague could write to another during a time of mental breakdown. Reisner must have had a very good heart to embrace a troubled man like Fisher so generously after all that Fisher had put him through."
"January 24, 1936",Fisher to Reisner once again looking for work.,"Fisher writes on stationery from the American School of Oriental Research Jerusalem, Palestine.
