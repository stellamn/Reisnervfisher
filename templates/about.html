        <p class="p">
            The Reisner/Fisher conflict took place primarily between the years 1917 and 1918. Two American archaeologists of Ancient Egypt, George Andrew Reisner and Clarence Fisher, argued over the management of members of their Egyptian workforce while they were excavating two different sites in Egypt. Reisner, the more established archaeologist, lent Fisher his reis (foreman)–a man named Mahmud el-Meyyit. Fisher fired el-Meyyit, accusing him of insubordination. Shortly after, Reisner hired el-Meyyit back, prompting indignation from Fisher who demanded Reisner fire el-Meyyit to preserve the integrity of both excavations. Reisner initially refused, citing an earlier instance where Fisher had hired a worker that Reisner had dismissed as proof of Fisher’s hypocrisy. While the men eventually settled their differences, the episode concluding with both Reisner and Fisher firing the workmen that the other had previously fired, the Reisner/Fisher conflict revealed the fragility of archaeological digs and their dependency on functioning worker relations.

        <h3>
            George Reisner
        </h3>

        <p class="p">
            George Andrew Reisner was an American archaeologist of Ancient Egypt, Palestine, and Nubia. He made significant contributions to scholarship on Ancient Egypt and is widely regarded as one of the founding fathers of American Egyptology. He was born in Indianapolis, Indiana on November 5, 1867. He attended Harvard University between 1885 and 1893, earning his bachelor’s degree, master’s degree, and Ph.D. during that time. He married Mary Bronson in 1892 and shortly after left to study Semitics in Berlin as a Harvard Traveling Fellow. In 1896, Reisner was appointed as a Semitic instructor for the academic year. Reisner later joined an excavation in Cairo, thus beginning his impressive period of participating on and directing digs in Egypt. His most notable discoveries include uncovering the tomb of Queen Hetepheres which contained, among the jewelry and finely decorated furniture, a mysteriously empty alabaster sarcophagus. During his time as an archaeologist, Reisner fostered deep connections with a network of skilled Egyptian families known as the Quftis that allowed him to make such great strides in his archaeological work.

        <h3>
            Clarence Fisher
        </h3>
        <p class="p">
            Clarence Fisher was an American Archaeologist who studied Ancient Egypt and Palestine. He was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on August 17, 1876. He attended the University of Pennsylvania where he earned an architecture degree. His introduction to archaeology came in the form of the Penn Babylonian expedition to Nippur between 1898 and 1900 where he served as the architect for the project. He worked as an assistant to George Reisner on several projects and their collaboration led to the development of the “Reisner-Fisher method” whereby a horizontal approach to excavation (one in which a larger area was examined possibly at a shallower depth) was favored over the vertical approach employed by excavators like Flinders Petrie. Fisher, after working for Reisner, was granted an expedition of his own and appointed the curator of the Penn Museum’s Egyptian section by the University. While embarking on this dig, he examined the sites of Giza, Denderah, and Memphis. Fisher was plagued by alcoholism and was eventually dismissed from the Penn Museum in 1924.

        <h3>
            The Qufti Archaeological Workforce
        </h3>
        <p class="p">
            The Qufti archaeological workforce are really the unsung heroes buttressing the efforts of Reisner and other Western archaeologists. In 1895, a British egyptologist named Flinders Petrie was excavating the cemetery of Naqada. He and his student, James Quibell, trained Egyptian workmen from the village of Quft to assist in uncovering artifacts at digs. After the third season of digging, the Quftis integrated the skills and knowledge associated with excavation into the social fabric of their community. Given their training and the fact that they were a large, tight-knit group of families, the Quftis were viewed as a coveted asset to archaeological digs. In 1899, Reisner traveled to Quft and began developing what would become a crucial and long-term relationship with the Quft families. As senior members of the Quft families became increasingly experienced, Reisner made them rais-es–leaders overseeing subgroups of other Qufti workers or, at times, running entire digs. Two key players who feature prominently in this historical narrative are brothers Mahmud al-Mayyit and Said Ahmed. Mahmud was a favorite of Reisner, who deemed him “ singly indispensable.” Reisner entrusted Said with the task of running various digs, though always with a token white Western archaeologist in tow.
