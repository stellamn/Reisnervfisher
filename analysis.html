            The Reisner-Fisher conflict threatened to unsettle both Reisner and Fisher’s expeditions. That this tumult caused by a worker-related conflict shook both men deeply reveals the importance of an archaeological workforce to the success of an excavation. It also raises questions about how the interconnectedness of the Qufti workforce contributed to not only the success of the expeditions they worked on, but also the relative instability of worker relations with western archaeologists. Ultimately, it is the same factors–loyalty, familial-duty, and honor–that contribute to both the successes and dangers inherent in the work that the Qufti families performed.

            Reisner relied on his men and trusted them implicitly. Because he was able to send a rais like Said Ahmed out to conduct digs, he could ostensibly be working in two places at once. The Qufti workers were skilled given their training, making them indispensable to Reisner because of the quality of the work he wanted to conduct. What’s more, Reisner did not have to worry about keeping his workers honest. The Qufti families were bound by honor and duty to uphold the integrity of their name. Thus theft was extremely uncommon, illustrated by a particularly tragic incident wherein one of Reisner’s workmen, Ali Ismain el Harrâs, pocketed a gold finger-case from a mummy. Ahmed reported him to Reisner and he was fired. Exiled from his family, having dishonored the Qufti name, Harrâs took his own life. The family discipline was strict and unforgiving, which lent itself an organized dig. Accordingly, the Qufti workforce was a deeply significant component of Reisner’s success as an archaeologist.

            Given that the Qufti workforce was so important to Reisner, it is understandable that any threat to the stability and loyalty of that workforce would pose a serious danger to Reisner’s ability to continue his work. On the flipside, Reisner’s dominant connection to the Qufti workers threatened Clarence Fisher’s authority over his workers. It is doubtful that the Qufti workers would have viewed the Penn expedition, led by Fisher, as materially distinguished from the Harvard-MFA expedition, led by Reisner. Since the Quftis had already established a working relationship with Reisner, it is natural that their allegiance should have been to him. Such loyalty was likely an offshoot of the familial loyalty which made the Quftis such desirable workers. Yet Clarence Fisher, hoping to break out from under the shadow of Reisner’s influence, could not assert his authority forcefully enough. He attempted to raise workers’ wages and improve conditions in the hopes of gaining favor, to no avail.

            Eventually, friction developed between Fisher and his rais Mahmud. Fisher accused Mahmud of being lazy and inefficient. Mahmud responded by quitting his position, prompting other workers to follow suit–no doubt because of familial loyalty. Fisher tried to spin the incident differently, saying instead that he had fired Mahmud for his poor performance. This episode emphasizes the potential drawbacks of the Qufti workforce in the sense that they are a non-transferable asset due to their loyalty to Reisner. To be clear, Fisher should be held responsible for the egotism that led to his criticism of Mahmud and insecurity in his authority, but the circumstances generated by the Quft families’ interconnected nature and deeply held values should nonetheless be taken into account.

            Reisner hired Mahmud back, possibly perceiving the rationale for his dismissal from Fisher’s expedition as something between the two men. This action offended Fisher because he believed that his workers would feel emboldened to be insubordinate if they knew they could still get a job with Reisner. Perhaps underlying Fisher’s anger was a desire that his dismissals be more damning. In other words, when Reisner dismissed men for grounds, they brought shame upon the family and were shunned. When Fisher dismissed men for what he perceived as grounds, Reisner welcomed him back into his expedition. Complicating that theory is the fact that Fisher had already hired a workman that Reisner had fired, which Reisner pointed out as clear hypocrisy on Fisher’s part. However, Reisner did not take umbrage with Fisher’s hiring practices until his own were called into question, implying that Reisner did not experience the feeling of being undermined to as great an extent as Fisher. Reisner ultimately decided to fire Mahmud, but only after consulting with Said and asking whether Mahmud’s dismissal would harm worker-morale.

            The whole incident is also laced with racism, primarily on Fisher’s part. While appealing to Reisner to fire Mahmud, Fisher accused Reisner of betraying his own race and protecting a “black” man, which is the term Fiser used for Egyptians. This descent into race-allegiance and a gross undervaluing of Egyptian workers further contextualizes the incident and allows us to see how Fisher’s motivations were driven by a concern for his ego.

            Ultimately, uncovering the nuances of this conflict allows us insight into the merits and drawbacks of an archaeological workforce that is essentially a family of skilled workers. Loyalty and honor are important and necessary factors that contribute to the success of expeditions, but they can also generate tension between expeditions and their leaders. Adequate blame must be assigned to Clarence Fisher for his outsized role in causing this conflict, but examining the conditions in which he generated the conflict is still an important avenue of inquiry.
